                                    Selling land, especially a piece of an existing property, is usually quite a complex
                                    process. It’s always worth more once the land has planning approval, which can take
                                    a while. And that’s why we work the way we do – valuing your land according to its
                                    post-planning-approval value. We try to make the process simpler for you as a
                                    seller, and the final buyer may want to or be able to pay cash for your land, but
                                    that’s not something we can guarantee.

                                    mortgage. However, you will need to speak to your lender about it.

                                    Yes, we may be interested in buying your roof space (also sometimes referred to as
                                    ‘air space’). It could be a flat roof, or an unconverted pitched roof. You do need

                                <p>
                                    An option agreement is a legally binding contract between you (the landowner) and a
                                    housebuilder. It gives them the option to buy the land within a fixed period of time
                                    for the price agreed when the option agreement is signed. This price is based on the
                                    post-approval value of the land. Here’s an example of our standard option agreement.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <h6>How does an option agreement benefit me?</h6>
                            <div class="description">
                                <p>
                                    With an option agreement, you have no costs to pay and you don’t have to get
                                    planning permission – that is down to the person who holds the option to buy your
                                    land. The sale price agreed in the option agreement assumes that they will get
                                    planning approval. This is how we can maximise your land’s value without you having
                                    to spend money on getting planning approval yourself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, there’s always a risk that the buyer won’t get planning permission for
                                    their specific design, and you can’t sell the land to anyone else until the option
                                    agreement has expired.

                                    We have plenty of experience in developing properties in unusual spaces and in
                                    applying for planning permission ourselves. This enables us to understand the
                                    potential value of a piece of land and maximise the amount you can sell it for
                                    without having planning permission. The final sale price written into the option
                                    agreement assumes that the buyer will get planning approval.

                                    We’re experienced at identifying plots with potential and can assess whether your

                                    If we believe that it can be, we organise a planning and conveyancing feasibility
                                    survey. The survey itself takes about half a day and finalising the report takes
                                    about a week. All in all, we should be able to present you with a valuation and an
                                    option agreement within 2 to 3 weeks of you contacting us.

                                    (Because we understand the potential of a space, the valuation will be based on what

                                    how we increase the value of every square foot you want to sell.)

                            <h6>Why could the money I make from selling part of my property be tax free?</h6>
                            <span>
                                The money you get for space you sell could be tax free if the property is your home.
                                Currently, Capital Gains Tax may not apply if you sell:

                                    This does depend on your tax status and other factors though, and you do need to
                                    make sure that you meet all of the HMRC’s criteria for this relief on paying Capital
                                    Gains Tax. Check the HMRC Guidance on Private Residence Relief (2015). Note that
                                    this legislation could change in the future.

                                    Tax law is complex and you should seek independent tax advice to determine and

                                    There is a lot of legislation around selling land, and sales can often take years.
                                    We understand this legislation and have years of experience in this area, as well as
                                    in land surveys and planning applications.

                                    We know what could be possible and will give you a valuation based on what can be
                                    developed on the land you sell, rather than just on the plot as it stands. That’s
                                    how we increase the value of every square foot of your space.

                                    on the first visit to your property. We’ll look at similar developments in the area
                                    and even consider the potential to develop below ground. <a href="#">Get a land
