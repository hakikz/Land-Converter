                            Often, it’s the complex legislation and the up-front costs associated with selling part of
                            your property that puts people off doing it. Sound familiar? Or maybe you’ve tried, but
                            three years later your vacant land is still on the market? No matter your situation, we can
                            make selling your unused space simpler.

                            Land with planning permission is worth more, but getting planning permission costs money.
                            With our experience in designing and building homes, we understand your land’s full
                            potential.

                        <p>
                            By assessing the likelihood of your land getting planning permission and putting a value on
                            your land that takes into account what could be built on it, you can maximise the value of
                            your land without spending money on planning yourself.

                                    If we believe it’s possible to get planning permission for the plot, we’ll discuss what your land’s worth. The suggested price for the plot you wish to sell will be based on the land’s market value, taking into account the size of the house that we believe could be approved. We use independent valuers agreed by both parties to determine this. We then draw up an agreement which assigns us a three-year option to gain planning permission then buy the land.

                                    We do need a minimum of around 500 square feet (approximately 46 square metres) to make a plot viable. That’s about the size of a double garage.

                                    No, not at all. There are many self-builders keen to think creatively and your space doesn’t need to be regular for it to have potential.

                                    Selling land, especially a piece of an existing property, is usually quite a complex process. It’s always worth more once the land has planning approval, which can take a while. And that’s why we work the way we do – valuing your land according to its post-planning-approval value. We try to make the process simpler for you as a seller, and the final buyer may want to or be able to pay cash for your land, but that’s not something we can guarantee.

                                    An option agreement is a legally binding contract between you (the landowner) and a housebuilder. It gives them the option to buy the land within a fixed period of time for the price agreed when the option agreement is signed.  This price is based on the post-approval value of the land. Here’s an example of our standard option agreement.                                 
                                </p>

                                    With an option agreement, you have no costs to pay and you don’t have to get planning permission – that is down to the person who holds the option to buy your land. The sale price agreed in the option agreement assumes that they will get planning approval. This is how we can maximise your land’s value without you having to spend money on getting planning approval yourself.                                 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, there’s always a risk that the buyer won’t get planning permission for their specific design, and you can’t sell the land to anyone else until the option agreement has expired.

                                    We have plenty of experience in developing properties in unusual spaces and in applying for planning permission ourselves. This enables us to understand the potential value of a piece of land and maximise the amount you can sell it for without having planning permission. The final sale price written into the option agreement assumes that the buyer will get planning approval.

                                    We can do initial desktop searches as soon as we receive your land valuation appraisal form, and will contact you within 24 hours to arrange to visit the site.

                                    If we believe that it can be, we organise a planning and conveyancing feasibility survey. The survey itself takes about half a day and finalising the report takes about a week. All in all, we should be able to present you with a valuation and an option agreement within 2 to 3 weeks of you contacting us.

                                The money you get for space you sell could be tax free if the property is your home. Currently, Capital Gains Tax may not apply if you sell:

                                    This does depend on your tax status and other factors though, and you do need to make sure that you meet all of the HMRC’s criteria for this relief on paying Capital Gains Tax. Check the HMRC Guidance on Private Residence Relief (2015). Note that this legislation could change in the future.

                                    Tax law is complex and you should seek independent tax advice to determine and understand the tax consequences of any property you sell, and how it may affect your tax position more generally.

                                    We can’t tell you unless we have some details of your property. However, we’re experienced at identifying plots with potential, and will be able to assess the land on the first visit to your property. We’ll look at similar developments in the area and even consider the potential to develop below ground. <a href="#">Get a land valuation now ></a>
